An **operator** is a special character or series of characters that perform a task in JavaScript.

## Assignment Operator

This operator uses the equals sign (`=`) to assign a value to a [variable](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/variables).

```js
let x = 42;
```

In the snippet above, a variable `x` is declared and the numeric value `42` is assigned to it.

## Arithmetic Operators

These operators are used to perform arithmetic on numeric values:

- `+`: Adds to a value; can also be used to concatenate [strings](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/strings).
- `-`: Subtracts from a value.
- `*`: Multiplies by a value.
- `/`: Divides by a value.
- `%`: [Modulo](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/modulo) finds the remainder after dividing two values.
- `**`: Returns the exponentiation of the first value raised to the power of the second value (first introduced in ES2016).
- `++`: Returns the value incremented by 1.
- `--`: Returns the value decremented by 1.

### Example

```js
let sum = 5 + 5;

let difference = 10 - 5;

let product = 5 * 10;

let quotient = 10 / 5;

let remainder = 10 % 5;
```

## Other Assignment Operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand:

- `+=`: Adds and assigns a new value to a variable.
- `-=`: Subtracts and assigns a new value to a variable.
- `*=`: Multiplies and assigns a new value to a variable.
- `/=`: Divides and assigns a new value to a variable.
- `%=`: Assigns the returned remainder (modulo) as a new value to a variable.
- `**=`: Assigns the left operand raised to the power of the right operand.

### Example

The following example showcases how these operators are a combination of using an assignment and arithmetic operator in one statement:

```js
let number = 100;

// Both statements will add 10
number = number + 10;
number += 10;

console.log(number);
// Output: 120
```

## Comparison Operators

These operators compare values and return a [boolean](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/boolean) value of `true` or `false`.

- `==`: Returns `true` or `false` based on whether the value of two operands are equal.
- `===`: Returns `true` or `false` based on whether the value and type of two operands are equal.
- `!=`: Returns `true` or `false` based on whether the value of two operands are not equal.
- `!==`: Returns `true` or `false` based on whether the value and type of two operands are not equal.
- `>`: Returns `true` or `false` based on whether the first value is greater than the second value.
- `<`: Returns `true` or `false` based on whether the first value is less than the second value.
- `>=`: Returns `true` or `false` based on whether the first value is greater than or equal to the second value.
- `<=`: Returns `true` or `false` based on whether the first value is less than or equal to the second value.

> **Note:** The `==` and `===` comparison operators are not to be confused with the single equality sign `=` operator that is used for assignment.

### Example

The following example showcases some of these comparison operators:

```js
let tenString = '10';
let numberTen = 10;

console.log(tenString == numberTen);
// Output: true

console.log(tenString === numberTen);
// Output: false

console.log(tenString != numberTen);
// Output: false

console.log(tenString !== numberTen);
// Output: true
```

## Logical Operators

These operators combine multiple boolean expressions or values to provide a single boolean output:

- `&&` (AND): Returns `true` if all operands evaluate to `true`.
- `||` (OR): Returns `true` if one or more operands evaluate to `true`.
- `!` (NOT): Returns the logical opposite of an operand's boolean value (i.e., `!(true)` returns `false` and `!(false)` returns `true`).

### Example

The following example showcases the usage of logical operators:

```js
const walksLikeADuck = true;
const talksLikeADuck = true;

// AND Operator
let isDuck = walksLikeADuck && talksLikeADuck;

console.log(isDuck);
// Output: true

const isBird = true;
const isPlane = false;

// OR Operator
isDuck = isBird || isPlane;

console.log(isDuck);
// Output: true

// NOT Operator
const isPenguin = !isDuck;

console.log(isPenguin);
// Output: false
```

## Conditional Operator

The conditional, or ternary, operator uses the question mark `?` and colon `:` characters to assign a value to a variable based on a conditional statement:

```pseudo
variable = condition ? assignedIfTrue : assignedIfFalse;
```

This operator combines the functionalities of the assignment, comparison, and logical operators.

### Codebyte Example

The following example showcases the conditional operator:

```codebyte/javascript
const walksLikeADuck = true;
const talksLikeADuck = true;

let isDuck = (walksLikeADuck && talksLikeADuck) ? "It's a duck" : "It's not a duck.";

console.log(isDuck);
```

The ternary operator can also perform multiple steps based on a certain condition, similar to the IF/ELSE condition statement.

For example, the following IF/ELSE statement...

```js
let i = true;
let a = 0;
let b = 0;

if (i == true) {
    a++;
    b++;
} else {
    a = 0;
    b = 0;
}
```

...can be translated into the following two-step ternary operator!

```js
let i = true;
let a = 0;
let b = 0;

i == true ? (a++, b++) : (a = 0, b = 0);
```

The ternary operator can also perform as many steps as you prefer.

```js
let i = true;
let a = 0;
let b = 0;
let c = 0;
//...

i == true ? (a++, b++, c++) : (a = 0, b = 0, c = 0);
```

The key point to focus on is the syntax. Pay special attention to where the `()`s are placed. A developer may make the mistake of using too many `()`s or placing the `()`s incorrectly, as shown below.

The following ternary operator will result in a SyntaxError:

```js
let i = true;

// This implementation will fail
i == true ? (a++), (b++) : (a = 0), (b = 0);

// Output:
// i == true ? (a++), (b++) : (a = 0), (b = 0);
//                  ^
// SyntaxError: Unexpected token ','
```

Although ternary operator and IF/ELSE performances speeds are [roughly the same](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2586842/is-ternary-operator-if-else-or-logical-or-faster-in-javascript#:~:text=test%20was%20fair-,Here%27s%20my%20jsperf,-result%3A), using multi-step ternary operators can help consolidate several lines of code, thus reducing file size and download time in the browser.
